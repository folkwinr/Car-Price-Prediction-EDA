# 🏷️ Phase 03 – Terminology Reference (English)

| Term | Description | Notes / Usage |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 🎯 Target | The main variable the model is trained to predict. In this project: **price**. | Target outliers can heavily distort model learning. |
| 📦 Feature | An input variable/column used for prediction. | Can be numeric or categorical. |
| 🚨 Outlier | A value that deviates significantly from the majority of the distribution. | May be a true extreme or a data entry error. |
| 🧠 Domain Rule | A rule derived from domain knowledge and logical constraints. | Example: `age < 0` is physically impossible. |
| 🧾 Data Entry Error | Incorrectly entered or generated data. | Typos, unit mismatches (cc vs L), parsing errors. |
| 🧱 IQR (Interquartile Range) | The range between Q3 and Q1. | A robust summary statistic for skewed distributions. |
| 🧱 Tukey Fence | IQR-based outlier limits: Q1 − 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR. | Widely used for heavy-tailed features. |
| ✂️ Pruning | Trimming extreme values to reduce their influence. | Can be done via dropping or capping. |
| 🗑️ Drop | Completely removing a row from the dataset. | Most definitive action, but causes data loss. |
| 🧢 Capping | Limiting extreme values to a predefined boundary. | Preserves rows while reducing extreme impact. |
| 🧢 Winsorization | Pulling extreme values toward percentile-based limits. | Typical example: 0.1%–99.9% bounds. |
| 🧯 Imputation | Filling missing or NaN values using statistical estimates. | Median, mode, or group-based methods. |
| 🧩 Group-based Imputation | Filling missing values using statistics from similar groups. | In this project: `make_model × body_type`. |
| 🧮 Median | The middle value of a distribution. | Robust to outliers; strong for continuous features. |
| 🧾 Mode | The most frequently occurring value. | Ideal for discrete or ordinal features. |
| 📏 Z-score | Standardization using (x − mean) / standard deviation. | Can be misleading for skewed distributions. |
| 🎚️ Z-score Threshold | The cutoff used to define outliers (typically \|z\| > 3). | Used for final stabilization in this phase. |
| 🧪 Skewness | The degree of asymmetry in a distribution. | If skewed, IQR or log methods are often safer. |
| 🐉 Heavy-tail | A distribution with long tails and many extreme values. | Typical for features like `price` and `mileage`. |
| 🧊 Discrete Feature | A feature that takes a limited set of distinct values. | Examples: `gears`, `previous_owner`. |
| 🧹 Noise Feature | A low-signal feature that degrades model performance. | `doors`, `seats` were dropped in this project. |
| 🧬 Duplicate | A repeated or identical record in the dataset. | Removed using `drop_duplicates`. |
| 🧯 Stabilization | Reducing the influence of outliers to calm distributions. | Leads to more stable model training. |
| 🧪 Validation Check | Post-cleaning verification step. | Shape, nulls, uniques, and distribution checks. |
| 🧼 Data Leakage | When information from the test set leaks into training. | All fitting and imputation must be train-only. |
| 🧰 Pipeline | A chained sequence of preprocessing and modeling steps. | Critical in Phase 04–05. |
| 🧾 Deliverable | Outputs exported at the end of a project phase. | Final CSVs, encoded datasets. |
| 🧭 Make-Model | Combined vehicle make and model identifier. | Improves segmentation and group imputation quality. |
| 🧱 Body Type | Vehicle body classification (Sedan, SUV, Hatch, etc.). | Key grouping feature. |
| 🏁 Model-ready Dataset | A clean, consistent dataset suitable for modeling. | Primary output of Phase 03. |
