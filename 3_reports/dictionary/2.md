# 📚 Part-02 Glossary (Handling Missing Values) 
Terms used in our **Missing Values** notebook (Part-02). Simple explanations, but still clear and professional.

---

## 1) Missing-Values Concepts
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| missing value | an empty value in a cell (no data) |
| NaN | “Not a Number”; a common missing value marker in pandas |
| null | another word for missing value |
| missing rate | the percentage of missing values in a column |
| imputation | filling missing values using a rule or method |
| fill | to replace missing values with a chosen value |
| baseline check | quick checks at the start (shape, info, missing summary) |
| data quality | how correct and usable the dataset is |
| consistency | values follow the same format and meaning everywhere |

---

## 2) Group-Based Filling (Key Strategy)
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| group | a set of rows that share the same category (example: same make_model) |
| group key | a column used to create groups (make_model, body_type, etc.) |
| groupby | pandas method to group rows by one or more columns |
| segment | a “similar car group” (example: same model + body type) |
| group-based imputation | filling missing values using values from the same group |
| hierarchical filling | filling with a strong group first, then weaker groups (fallback) |
| fallback | a backup step if the first fill method cannot fill values |
| transform | apply a group result to each row (example: group mean for each row) |
| mode | the most frequent value in a group |
| median | the middle value (more stable if outliers exist) |
| mean | the average value (can be affected by outliers) |

---

## 3) Methods We Used (When and Why)
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| mode fill | fill missing values with the most common value in the group |
| median fill | fill missing values with the group median (robust to outliers) |
| mean fill | fill missing values with the group mean (average) |
| ffill (forward fill) | fill missing using the previous value in the group |
| bfill (backward fill) | fill missing using the next value in the group |
| propagation | filling by spreading existing values inside a group (ffill+bfill) |
| rule-based fill | filling by a logical rule instead of stats (example: warranty Yes/No) |
| domain rule | a rule based on real-world knowledge (example: Electric CO2) |

---

## 4) Text Repair and Extraction (Model Fix)
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| regex | a pattern used to find text (regular expression) |
| pattern | the rule used in regex |
| extraction | taking specific text from a string (example: model name) |
| short_description | a text column used as a source to recover missing model values |
| helper column | a temporary column used only to solve a task (then dropped) |
| cleaning text | making text consistent (lower/Title Case, removing noise) |
| Title Case | first letter capital in each word (example: “Ford Mustang”) |

---

## 5) Domain Terms (Car Logic Used in Filling)
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| make | car brand (Audi, BMW, etc.) |
| model | the car model (A3, 320, etc.) |
| make_model | brand + model together |
| body_type | SUV, sedan, hatchback, etc. |
| age | how old the car is (often derived from registration year) |
| mileage | how many kilometers the car has driven |
| fuel_type | petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid, etc. |
| Electric | cars that use battery power (special rules applied) |
| CO2 emissions | CO₂ output, often in g/km |
| consumption | fuel or energy usage (example: L/100km or similar) |
| warranty | guarantee; in our notebook we simplified it to Yes/No |
| gearbox | manual/automatic (transmission type) |
| gears | number of gears |
| drivetrain | FWD/RWD/AWD (how power goes to wheels) |
| upholstery | seat material (cloth, leather, etc.) |

---

## 6) Feature Engineering Terms (Packages)
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| feature engineering | creating new useful columns from existing data |
| package feature | a simplified category built from many equipment items |
| keyword rule | checking if specific words exist in text (for package levels) |
| Premium / Premium Plus | higher equipment levels created by rules |
| Standard | base equipment level created by rules |
| long text equipment | equipment columns with long lists/text (comfort/media/safety) |
| noise reduction | removing messy columns after creating better features |

---

## 7) Output and Reporting
| Term | Meaning (B1–B2) |
|---|---|
| final dataset | the dataset after Part-02 steps are complete |
| output file | the saved result (filled_scout2022.csv) |
| drop | remove a column or row |
| redundant | not needed because another column already has the same information |
| sanity check | quick logic check to see if results make sense |
| anomaly | a value that looks wrong (example: Electric car with high CO2) |
