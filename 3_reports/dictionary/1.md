# 📚 Project Dictionary (Glossary) — AutoScout24 Dataset + Part-01 Notebook Terms
Simple English (B1–B2). Terms are taken from the **notebook text + code** and the **raw dataset context**.

| listing | one car advertisement/offer |
| record / row | one line in the dataset (one listing) |
| column / feature | one variable in the dataset (price, mileage, etc.) |
| schema | the structure of the dataset (column names and types) |
| exploratory data analysis (EDA) | first look at the data to understand it |
| missing values | empty data in a cell |
| null | empty / missing value (often the same idea as missing) |
| NaN | “Not a Number”, a common missing value in pandas |
| missing rate | percent of missing values in a column |
| threshold | a rule limit (example: drop columns with >80% missing) |
| duplicate | a repeated row/listing |
| unique | different values in a column |
| outlier | a value that is very unusual compared to others |
| validation | checks to make sure data is correct (range, type, etc.) |
| categorical | data as groups/labels (example: fuel type) |
| numeric | data as numbers (example: price, mileage) |
| type casting | changing a data type (string → number) |
| parsing | taking useful parts from text (extract numbers from strings) |
| normalization | making values more consistent (same style/format) |
| standardization | making a standard format (like snake_case names) |

## 2) Python / pandas Words (Used in the notebook code)
| Term | Simple meaning |
|---|---|
| pandas | a Python library for working with tables (DataFrames) |
| DataFrame | a table in pandas (rows × columns) |
| Series | one column in pandas |
| dtype | data type of a column (object, int, float, etc.) |
| object (dtype) | often means “text”, but can also hide mixed types |
| copy | make a safe duplicate of the dataset |
| inplace | change the data directly (without making a new object) |
| index | row labels/row positions in pandas |
| axis | direction: 0 = rows, 1 = columns |
| drop | remove rows or columns |
| dropna | remove missing data (rows/cols) using rules |
| isna / notna | check if values are missing / not missing |
| duplicated | find repeated rows |
| value_counts | count how many times each value appears |
| nunique | number of unique values |
| astype | change a column type (example: string → float) |
| to_numeric | convert text to numbers safely |
| errors='coerce' | convert bad values to NaN instead of crashing |
| apply | apply a function to each value in a column |
| lambda | a short, inline function (quick function) |
| split | cut text into parts (example: by “/”) |
| strip | remove spaces or unwanted characters at the start/end |
| replace | replace text patterns (example: remove “,”) |
| join | combine list items into one string |
| extract | pull a part from text (often with regex) |
| explode | turn list values into separate rows (**can change row count**) |
| ignore_index | reset index after operations like drop/explode |

## 3) Regex (Regular Expression) Words (Important in parsing)
| Term | Simple meaning |
|---|---|
| regex / regular expression | a text rule to find and extract patterns |
| pattern | the regex rule you use |
| match | text that fits the pattern |
| group | a captured part of the match (inside parentheses) |
| named group | a group with a name (example: `(?P<hp>...)`) |
| `\d` | “a digit” (0–9) |
| `+` | “one or more times” in regex |
| `?` | “optional” (0 or 1 time) |
| `.` (dot) | **any character** (not a real dot) |
| `\.` | a real dot character |
| `[.,]` | either a dot or a comma (useful for decimals) |
